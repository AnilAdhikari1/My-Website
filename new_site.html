<section class="about-text">
  <p>
    As a<strong> Computer engineering & ethical hacker</strong> at IT Security, I work with a team of experts to protect the data and systems of our clients from
    malicious attacks. I use my knowledge of programming languages such as Python, C, SQL, and JavaScript to identify vulnerabilities, test security
    measures and recommend solutions. I also have experience in web development, using tools such as Figma, HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub to create and maintain websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing an introduction to ethical hacking course from Great Learning, where I learn the fundamentals of cybersecurity, network security, 
    cryptography, and penetration testing. I am also a computer engineering student at Bal Uddhar Secondary School, where I completed an on-the-job training
    report on designing a blood bank management system and computer hardware and networking. I have obtained certifications in computer hardware and networking,
    and on-the-job training report documentation. I am passionate about learning new things every day and enhancing my technical skills and experience.
    My goal is to become a proficient and ethical hacker who can contribute to the security and safety of the digital world.
